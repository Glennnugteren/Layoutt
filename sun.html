		</h1>
			<p class="p22">
					Sunnery James – Diving Dutch – Fresh from putting out ‘The One That Got Away‘ featuring Clara Mae as the first release on their new SONO MUSIC label, Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano are now to take part in another big happening. The Dutch DJs dropped the first-ever underwater DJ set aboard an actual submarine during the evening show Frank en Vrijdagshow, on Radio 538, the biggest broadcasting station in the Netherlands.
					The Frank en Vrijdagshow is a Friday evening show on Holland’s biggest broadcasting station, Radio 538. For this unique edition called Diving Dutch, the broadcasting station joined forces with the Royal Netherlands Navy. Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, whose Sexy By Nature radio show is also broadcast on Radio 538 every Saturday, were invited to the show as special guests and dropped a live set right after the show.<br>
